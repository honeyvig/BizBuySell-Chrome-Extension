### **Responsibilities**:
1. Diagnose and resolve the issue preventing the DOM updates on BizBuySell webpages.
2. Ensure the extension successfully injects dynamic partner data (name and distance) into the appropriate listing elements.
3. Review and refine existing content scripts for efficiency and robustness.
4. Test and validate the extension across multiple BizBuySell listing pages and scenarios (e.g., pagination, dynamic content loading).
5. Optimize error handling and logging for easier troubleshooting and maintainability.
6. Ensure compatibility with Chrome's latest extension standards and best practices.

### **Requirements**:
1. Proven experience in building or troubleshooting Chrome Extensions.
2. Strong knowledge of:
   - JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
   - Chrome Extension APIs (e.g., content scripts, background scripts, messaging).
   - Debugging tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools).
3. Familiarity with dynamic content handling (e.g., `MutationObserver`, lazy loading).
4. Understanding of web security, browser permissions, and manifest file configuration.

----------
To address the issue where the Chrome extension is failing to update the BizBuySell webpage DOM with partner and distance information, we can approach the solution in several steps. The key is diagnosing the problem, ensuring that the DOM is properly updated with the correct partner data, and optimizing the extension for efficiency and robustness.
Solution Outline

Here’s an approach to resolving the issue:
1. Diagnose the Issue:

    Check if the extension is successfully fetching the partner data (e.g., using an API like Supabase).
    Check if the content script is correctly identifying the right DOM elements for injecting the partner data.
    Ensure that the DOM is updated after the partner data is fetched.
    Ensure that the extension correctly handles dynamic content loading (e.g., using MutationObserver for handling pagination).

2. Core Features:

    Fetch Partner Data: Ensure the extension fetches the nearest partner and distance data correctly using an API.
    Update the DOM: Inject partner name and distance information into the correct elements.
    Handle Dynamic Content: Use MutationObserver to handle dynamic content and updates to the DOM.

Step-by-Step Code Implementation
Manifest File (manifest.json):

This file configures the Chrome extension, defines permissions, and specifies the content script.

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "BizBuySell Partner Distance Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Displays the nearest partner and distance for BizBuySell listings.",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://www.bizbuysell.com/*"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://www.bizbuysell.com/businesses-for-sale/*"],
      "js": ["content.js"],
      "css": ["styles.css"]
    }
  ]
}

Background Script (background.js):

The background script manages the extension lifecycle and communicates with APIs for fetching partner data.

// This script will handle the background tasks and API calls (e.g., fetching partner data)
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  console.log('BizBuySell Partner Distance Extension Installed');
});

// Example of fetching partner data from a third-party API like Supabase or any other API
async function fetchPartnerData(businessId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/partners?businessId=${businessId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching partner data:', error);
  }
}

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message.action === 'getPartnerData') {
    fetchPartnerData(message.businessId).then(data => {
      sendResponse({ partnerData: data });
    });
    return true; // Indicates we are sending a response asynchronously
  }
});

Content Script (content.js):

This is where the magic happens: manipulating the DOM to inject the partner and distance data. We'll also handle dynamic content loading here using MutationObserver.

// Function to update the DOM with partner information
function updateDOMWithPartnerData(partnerData, businessElement) {
  // Create a new element to display the partner name and distance
  const partnerInfo = document.createElement('div');
  partnerInfo.classList.add('partner-info');
  partnerInfo.innerHTML = `<strong>Nearest Partner:</strong> ${partnerData.name} <br><strong>Distance:</strong> ${partnerData.distance} miles`;

  // Insert the partner info into the business listing element
  businessElement.appendChild(partnerInfo);
}

// Function to fetch partner data for each business listing
function fetchAndUpdatePartnerData(businessId, businessElement) {
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage(
    { action: 'getPartnerData', businessId: businessId },
    (response) => {
      const partnerData = response.partnerData;
      if (partnerData) {
        updateDOMWithPartnerData(partnerData, businessElement);
      } else {
        console.log('No partner data found for business:', businessId);
      }
    }
  );
}

// Function to find all business listings on the page and process them
function processListings() {
  const listings = document.querySelectorAll('.listing-card'); // Adjust to the actual class name
  listings.forEach(listing => {
    const businessId = listing.getAttribute('data-business-id');
    fetchAndUpdatePartnerData(businessId, listing);
  });
}

// MutationObserver to handle dynamically loaded content (pagination, etc.)
const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
  processListings();
});

// Start observing the page for DOM changes (e.g., when new listings are loaded)
observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });

// Initial processing of listings on page load
processListings();

CSS for Styling (styles.css):

Basic CSS for styling the injected partner information.

.partner-info {
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
  padding: 10px;
  margin-top: 5px;
  font-size: 14px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
}

.partner-info strong {
  font-weight: bold;
}

Detailed Walkthrough:

    manifest.json: The manifest file is the configuration for the extension, specifying the content scripts, background scripts, permissions, and API URLs.

    Background Script (background.js):
        Handles fetching data from an external API (like Supabase).
        Responds to messages from the content script when it needs partner data.
        The fetchPartnerData function makes an API call to get partner data for a given business listing.

    Content Script (content.js):
        updateDOMWithPartnerData: This function creates an HTML element that displays the partner’s name and distance and appends it to the business listing.
        fetchAndUpdatePartnerData: For each business listing, this function sends a message to the background script to fetch partner data and then updates the DOM.
        processListings: This function scans the page for business listings and processes each listing to fetch and display partner data.
        MutationObserver: This is used to handle dynamically loaded content (e.g., when the user navigates to the next page of listings or when more listings are loaded via lazy loading).

    styles.css: Basic CSS to ensure the partner information is presented clearly.

Testing and Validation:

    Test Dynamic Content: Make sure the MutationObserver works with dynamic content. For example, when you scroll or paginate, the new listings should also display partner data correctly.
    Test API: Make sure that the API response structure aligns with how data is being handled in the extension (e.g., partnerData.name and partnerData.distance).
    Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensure the extension works in Chrome and meets the latest Chrome extension standards.
    Error Handling: Enhance the error handling in the background script and content script to ensure better diagnostics during runtime.

Deliverables:

    The extension will be fully functional, displaying partner names and distances in the business listing.
    A detailed report documenting the changes made to the code, the troubleshooting steps taken, and any known limitations.
    Recommendations for ongoing testing, including handling edge cases and optimizing performance.

This approach should address the issues you're experiencing, and the extension will now dynamically fetch and display partner information on BizBuySell listing pages.
